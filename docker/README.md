# TestLogAnalyzer - Docker packaging

This project has been packaged by using Docker. In each component (elasticsearch, testloganalyzer and testloganalyzer-gui) you can find each Dockerfile. These Dockerfiles are composed in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

You have to execute `docker-compose up` and navigate to the gui at `localhost:4200` or use the API system at `localhost:8443`.

That's it!
